  <h2>89. Alerts, mdn and course notes</h2>
  <p>
    The Window.alert() method displays an alert dialog with the optional specified content and an OK button.
    We usually just type alert().
  </p>
  <p>
    The alert dialog should be used for messages which do not require any response on the part of the user, other than
    the acknowledgement of the message.

    Dialog boxes are modal windows - they prevent the user from accessing the rest of the program's interface until the
    dialog box is closed. For this reason, you should not overuse any function that creates a dialog box (or modal
    window).</p>

  <h2>90. Data Types</h2>
  <p>Type (or data type) is a characteristic of a value affecting what kind of data it can store â€” for example in
    JavaScript a Boolean only holds true/false values, whereas a String holds text strings, a Number holds numbers of
    any kind, and so on.</p>
  <p>
    A value's data type also affects which operations are valid on that value. For example, an integer can be
    multiplied by an integer, but not by a string.</p>

  <h2>91. Variables</h2>
  <p>A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.</p>
  <script>
    // L.91
    // prompt("What is your name?");
    // need to save this to memory
    var name = prompt("What is your name?");
    alert("Hello " + name);
    // L.89
    // alert("Console tip: Hold down shift for multi line instructions");
  </script>
